# py&ntilde;a

Python analysis for Nucleic Acids. Analysis scripts for Curves output.

Curves can be a bit messy to deal with. Py&ntilde;a helps you get through
the tough rind on the outside and into the sweet and juicy results you're
looking for.

### Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Pandas
* [Curves+](http://bisi.ibcp.fr/tools/curves_plus/)

### Recommended/Required for some routines:

* matplotlib
* ffmeg or mplayer (for `AnimatedDataFrame`)
* IPython (we recommend IPython notebooks for interactive analysis and
  visualization.)

### Recommended Installation

We strongly recommend use of [anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) or
[miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) to manage your Python
installation. A full anaconda install will include `pandas`, `IPython`, and
`matplotlib`. If you use miniconda, you should manually install `pandas`.

Currently, the recommended approach to install py&ntilde;a is to download
the GitHub repository, and to install using `pip install -e .`. This allows
you to use `git pull` to get updates to this still-developing project.

This will allow you to quickly install pyña with:

`TODO`

Pyña can also be installed through `pip`:

`TODO`

Finally, one can always install pyña by downloaded the source from the
github repository and installing with either `pip install .` or `python
setup.py`
